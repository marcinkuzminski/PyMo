# PyMo - Simple MongoDB Terminal Browser

You live within the terminal app? And you need to frequently check changes of your MongoDB database? Then PyMo is the right tool for you! 

PyMo letâ€™s you browse your MongoDB databases and collections. You can also list your latest documents and update or delete them. 

PyMo was designed for maximum simplicity and speed of usage. It is written in Python and uses the PyMongo module.

### Installation

Just put pymo.py in a folder of your choice and make it executable with `chmod +x pymo.py`. Then run PyMo via `./pymo.py` when you are in that folder (while being in your terminal, of course).

You may also need to install [PyMongo](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/). If you already have [PIP](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed then you can do a `sudo pip install pymongo`

### Contribution

Please contribute to the PyMo project and add extra core features. But always keep in mind that less is more and PyMo should stay super simple and snappy to use. Thanks!
